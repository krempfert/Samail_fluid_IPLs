# plots

This directory should hold any output plots (e.g. pdf, png, jpeg) that are generated by your RMarkdown files and jupyter notebooks.

By default, none of the files in this folder are added to GitHub because they can be generated from your data processing scripts. If you want to ADD any particular file to GitHub anyways, use the `.gitignore` file in this directory.
