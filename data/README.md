# data

This directory should hold all of your raw data files, no matter the format (e.g. Excel, CSV, image data, etc.). Use subfolders to structure your data further if you have a lot of differeny kinds. All data files should be treated as **read only**.

If you want to prevent any particular data file or data subfolder from being automatically added to GitHub, simply list their names in the `.gitignore` file that is in this directory.
