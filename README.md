# Database Creation 

First, use "IPL_calculator.Rmd" to create a list of unique compounds that can be appended to the CompTable for LOBSTAHS (e.g. "unique_lipids_em_v3.csv" found in the "IPL_calculator" subfolder of the "data" folder). Then use "LOBSTAHS_database_generation.Rmd" to generate the full database.

Alternatively, a .csv file of our custom database (LOBSTAHS_lipid-oxy_DB_pos_2021-01-13T11-44-48_PM-0700_updated_1_22_21.csv) is available in the of "Full_database" subfolder of the "LOBSTAHS_db_generation" folder.
